/* <base/not_implemented.h>

   Use NOT_IMPLEMENTED() as a stub implementation for things which are not implemented. Allows you
   to get to full
   compilation of a module more quickly and easily determine where you need to work next to make
   something implemented.

   Uses std::logic_error instead of a custom exception. */
