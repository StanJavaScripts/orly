/* <base/rigid_subprocess.h>

   Run a subprocess and communicate with it.

   I/O between the parent and child processes is rigid.  Contrast this with
   <base/subprocess>, in which communication between the parent and child is
   handled with <base/pump>, preventing writes from blocking when the reads
   are delayed.
