Rewrite/rework test harness notes:
    TestContext (Singleton)
      - gives the verbose flag, static function member w/ setter
      - Results can be written to it

    Fixtures auto-attach as before, now via a function (AttachFixture)
      - Fixtures can attach qualifiers?

      TODO: Standard test setup/breakdown things which are attached as named tags for
      environment prep / config?

Rewrite make_dep_file to use <cmd/args.h>

Configure for JHM (CXX, CC, CXXFLAGS, CCFLAGS, LD, LDFLAGS):
  - Ideally also allow adding platform/tool/etc. specific variables/flags to config.
  - Have a 'setup' step analogous to ./configure
  - Captures a static set of environment variables which are then used
    for the build.

Cross-project includes / dependencies
Download third party packages / repositories
  - Either #include <github.com/foo/bar>
  - Dependency file which maps repo to some include prefix.


Simpler <base/split.h> (With a better name)?

Bootstrap script generator
  - Bootstrapping test?


Test / examples for several open source codebases?

A good Single Producer Multiple Consumer queue to


Unify on THROWER

Simplify thrower interface

Command line autocompletion

-c release.jhm should build config named 'release', not one named 'release.jhm'

A great many config options should be optional to specify (cmd.ld.libs, cmd.ld.flags, etc)

Cleanup base/json API

Allow simple plugging of tools (Loadable modules + Text API)

buildit -- wrapper for other build systems (Need to ingest autoconf / makefiles, CMake)
