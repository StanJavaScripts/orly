Rewrite <base/cmd>
  - Testing: `jhm jhm/jhm --help` doesn't work right


Rewrite/rework test harness notes:
    TestContext (Singleton)
      - gives the verbose flag, static function member w/ setter
      - Results can be written to it


    Fixtures auto-attach as before, now via a function (AttachFixture)
      - Fixtures can attach qualifiers?

      TODO: Standard test setup/breakdown things which are attached as named tags for
      environment prep / config?


Simpler <base/split.h> (With a better name)?

Utilize CXX, CXXFLAGS, CC, CCFLAGS
  - Have a 'setup' step analogous to ./configure
  - Captures a static set of environment variables which are then used
    for the build.

Bootstrap script generator

Download third party packages / repositories

Cross-project includes / dependencies

A good Single Producer Multiple Consumer queue

OS X Support
  - Simultaneous Linux support, bootstrap script which handles both.

buildit -- wrapper for other build systems (Need to ingest autoconf / makefiles, CMake)

Unify on THROWER

Simplify thrower interface

Command line autocompletion

-c release.jhm should build config named 'release', not one named 'release.jhm'

A great many config options should be optional to specify (cmd.ld.libs, cmd.ld.flags, etc)

Cleanup base/json API

Allow simple plugging of tools (Loadable modules + Text API)
