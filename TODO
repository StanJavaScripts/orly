Configure for JHM (CXX, CC, CXXFLAGS, CCFLAGS, LD, LDFLAGS):
  - Ideally also allow adding platform/tool/etc. specific variables/flags to config.
  - Have a 'setup' step analogous to ./configure
  - Captures a static set of environment variables which are then used
    for the build.

Cross-project includes / dependencies
Download third party packages / repositories
  http://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_paths
  - Either #include <github.com/foo/bar>
  - Dependency file which maps repo to some include prefix.

Test / examples for several open source codebases?

Command line autocompletion

No folders outside of root folder mode

Simpler <base/split.h> (With a better name)?

Bootstrap script generator
  - Bootstrapping test?

A good Single Producer Multiple Consumer queue to

Unify on THROWER w/ reduced (Simplified) interface.

-c release.jhm should build config named 'release', not one named 'release.jhm'

A great many config options should be optional to specify (cmd.ld.libs, cmd.ld.flags, etc)

Cleanup base/json API

Allow simple plugging of tools (Loadable modules + Text API)

Extend / clean test harness:
  - Isolators? (Network, etc)
  - Preconditions (needs 5 GB ram, 10 cores, root, sole of type, etc.)
  - Run fixtures in parallel?
  - The test output code is hard to follow, result pages not always the cleanest
  - XML output report for consumption via existing tools.

buildit -- wrapper for other build systems (Need to ingest autoconf / makefiles, CMake)
